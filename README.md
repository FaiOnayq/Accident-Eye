# Real-Time Road Accident Detection System

This repository contains the implementation of a **real-time road accident detection system** using surveillance cameras. The system is based on four different models: **YOLO, CNN**, and two hybrid approaches (**YOLO-XGBoost** and **CNN-XGBoost**). The project aims to enhance road safety by automating accident detection and severity classification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Introduction

Road accidents are a critical global issue, causing fatalities and long-term injuries. Delayed emergency response times exacerbate the problem. This project use **deep learning** and **hybrid techniques** to detect accidents in real-time using images captured by surveillance cameras.


## üìä Dataset

The dataset has acquisition from kaggle [1] and is divided into 4 classes:
1. **Accident Scenarios**:
   - Minor Impact
   - Substantial Impact
   - Critical Impact
2. **Non-Accident Scenarios**

### Preprocessing Steps:
- **Resizing**: Images resized to 320x320 pixels.
- **Augmentation**: Techniques include flipping, cropping, brightness adjustment, and noise addition.
- **Balancing**: Class distribution was balanced using data augmentation to prevent bias.



## ü§ñ Models

### 1. YOLO
- **Description**: State-of-the-art detection model optimized for real-time performance.

### 2. CNN
- **Description**: Focused on feature extraction and classification for accident detection.

### 3. YOLO-XGBoost
- **Description**: Combines YOLO‚Äôs feature extraction with XGBoost for improved classification performance.

### 4. CNN-XGBoost
- **Description**: Combines CNN‚Äôs feature extraction with XGBoost for improved classification performance.
